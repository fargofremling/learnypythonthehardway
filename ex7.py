# Chapter 7 Study Drills

# 1. Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.

# Command to print the following string.
print "Mary had a little lamb."
# Command to print the following string with a %s formatting character.
print "Its fleece was what as %s." % 'snow'
# Command to print the following string.
print "And everywhere that Mary went."
# Command to print a period 10 times.
print "." * 10

# Sets the variable end1 to C.
end1 = "C"
# Sets the variable end2 to h.
end2 = "h"
# Sets the variable end3 to e.
end3 = "e"
# Sets the variable end4 to e.
end4 = "e"
# Sets the variable end5 to s.
end5 = "s"
# Sets the variable end6 to e.
end6 = "e"
# Sets the variable end7 to B.
end7 = "B"
# Sets the variable end8 to u.
end8 = "u"
# Sets the variable end9 to r.
end9 = "r"
# Sets the variable end10 to g.
end10 = "g"
# Sets the variable end11 to e.
end11 = "e"
# Sets the variable end12 to r.
end12 = "r"

# Command to print variables end1 - end6. The common on the end indicates the next line of code is a continuation of the previous line of code.
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6,
# Command to print variables end7 - end12.
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12


# 2. Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
