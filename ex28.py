# Study Drills
# 1. There are a lot of operators in Python similar to != and ==. Try to find as many "equality operators" as you can. 
#	They should be like < or <=.
# 2. Write out the names of each of these equality operators. For example, I call != "not equal."

#  == equal
#  != not equal
#  > greater than
#  >= greater than or equal to
#  < less than
#  <= less than or equal to
