# Chapter 3 Exercise

print "I will now count my chickens:"

print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

print "Now I will count the eggs:"

print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7

print "Oh, that's why it's False."

print "How about some more."

print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2


# Chapter 3 Study Drills


# 1. Above each line, use the "#" to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.

#Prints the statement to count chickens
print "I will now count my chickens:"

#Calculates and prints the sum of Hens
print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6
#Calculates and prints the sum of Roosters
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

#Prints the statement to count eggs
print "Now I will count the eggs:"

#Calculates the sum of eggs
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

#Asks an inequality question
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

#Analyzes the inequality and returns a Boolean value
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

#Asks an arithmetic problem and calculates the sum
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
#Asks an arithmetic problem and calculates the sum
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7

#Prints the statement that the solution is false
print "Oh, that's why it's False."

#Requests more arithmetic problems
print "How about some more."

#Asks and analyzes an inequality
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
#Asks and analyzes an inequality
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
#Asks and analyzes an inequality
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2


#2. Find something that needs to be calculated and write code that does it.

print "How much older is my mom than me?"
print "My mom is 65 years old, and I am 31 years old."
print "She is", 65 - 31, "years older."

#3. Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.

print "I will now count my chickens:"

print "Hens", 25.0 + 30.0 / 6.0
print "Roosters", 100.0 - 25.0 * 3.0 % 4.0

print "Now I will count the eggs:"

print 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 - 5.0 + 4.0 % 2.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 + 6.0

print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

print 3.0 + 2.0 < 5.0 - 7.0

print "What is 3 + 2?", 3.0 + 2.0
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5.0 - 7.0

print "Oh, that's why it's False."

print "How about some more."

print "Is it greater?", 5.0 > -2.0
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5.0 >= -2.0
print "Is it less or equal?", 5.0 <= -2.0
