# Chapter 5 Study Drills


# 1. Change all the variables so there is no my_ in front of each one. Make sure you change the name everywhere, not just where you used = to set them.

name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
age = 35 # not a lie
height = 74 # inches
weight = 180 # lbs
eyes = 'Blue'
teeth = 'White'
hair = 'Brown'

print "Let's talk about %s." % name
print "He's %d inches tall." % height
print "He's %d pounds heavy." % weight
print "Actually that's not too heavy."
print "He's got %s eyes and %s hair." % (eyes, hair)
print "His teeth are usually %s depending on the coffee." % teeth

# this line is trick, try to get it exactly right
print "If I add %d, %d, and %d, I get %d." % (age, height, weight, age + height + weight)


# 2. Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms. Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Python.

name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
age = 35 # not a lie
height = 74 # inches
weight = 180 # lbs
eyes = 'Blue'
teeth = 'White'
hair = 'Brown'

cm_height = height * 2.54
kg_weight = weight * 0.453592

print "Let's talk about %s." % name
print "He's %d centimeters tall." % cm_height
print "He's %d kilograms heavy." % kg_weight
print "Actually that's not too heavy."
print "He's got %s eyes and %s hair." % (eyes, hair)
print "His teeth are usually %s depending on the coffee." % teeth

# this line is trick, try to get it exactly right
print "If I add %d, %d, and %d, I get %d." % (age, cm_height, kg_weight, age + cm_height + kg_weight)


# 3. Search online for all of the Python format characters.

# 'd'	Signed integer decimal.
# 'i'	Signed integer decimal.
# 'o'	Signed octal value.
# 'u'	Obsolete type â€“ it is identical to 'd'.
# 'x'	Signed hexadecimal (lowercase).
# 'X'	Signed hexadecimal (uppercase).
# 'e'	Floating point exponential format (lowercase).
# 'E'	Floating point exponential format (uppercase).
# 'f'	Floating point decimal format.
# 'F'	Floating point decimal format.
# 'g'	Floating point format. Uses lowercase exponential format if exponent is less than -4 or not less than precision, decimal format otherwise.
# 'G'	Floating point format. Uses uppercase exponential format if exponent is less than -4 or not less than precision, decimal format otherwise.
# 'c'	Single character (accepts integer or single character string).
# 'r'	String (converts any Python object using repr()).
# 's'	String (converts any Python object using str()).
# '%'	No argument is converted, results in a '%' character in the result.
