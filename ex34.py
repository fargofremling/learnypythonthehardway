# Study Drills

# 1. With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, can you explain 
# why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010," really is 2010 and not 2009? (Hint: you can't 
# pick years at random.)
# - January 1, 2010 is in fact 2010, because years are ordinal numbers, therefore 1 is 1, 
# - and 2010 is 2010.
# 2. Write some more lists and work out similar indexes until you can translate them.
# 3. Use Python to check your answers.
